	<p>What is this? Well, after years of trading stocks, I have an equation I use to figure how well a stock fits my needs and strategy. However, doing the work manually for every stock, for every time I buy, is time consuming. So, I thought, "Why not program something up?"</p>
	<p><strong>BlaherDex</strong> will be an Ratings index, that rate the index of stocks that qualify for my interests. Not only will this allow me to get a automation of the information I need, but it will now allow me to easily compare stock performance. The site will also include a guide to my entire financial strategy and structure, and could prove useful to others. There will also be a few tools, such as calculating what I need for an OTOCO/OCO order.</p>
	<p>The project will also help me explore the latest version of Code Igniter, an PHP MVC platform, and there a few development aspects I wanted to try or revisit.</p>
